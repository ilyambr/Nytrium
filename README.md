**Nytrium**

 is an open-source dual-boot gaming launcher for Linux users. It simplifies managing and playing Windows-only games by setting up a lightweight Windows partition for gaming while keeping full control from Linux. With Nytrium, you can easily switch between operating systems, manage game installations, and customize settingsâ€”all from a single app.
